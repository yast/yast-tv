TODO for yast2-tv
-----------------

- Better generation of databases:
  - data/CARDLIST.bttv is
      /usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv/CARDLIST from
      kernel-sources.rpm,
    data/CARDLIST.saa7134 is
      /usr/src/kernel-modules/v4l2/saa7134-*/CARDLIST from km_v4l2.rpm
  - they both could be generated directly from the sources:
    /usr/src/kernel-modules/v4l2/bttv-*/bttv-cards.c and
    /usr/src/kernel-modules/v4l2/saa7134-*/saa7134-cards.c
    from km_v4l2.rpm package

- the support for saa7134 sould work out of the box, but must be tested.
  Note: take care if it gets to libhd as well. More info:

  Subject: new tv cards, new driver ...
  
    Hi,
  
  You might have noticed that there is a new tv card chipset from
  Philips (SAA7130/SAA7134):
  
  bogomips kraxel ~# lspci -vs d    
  00:0d.0 Multimedia controller: Philips Semiconductors: Unknown device 7134 (rev 01)
          Subsystem: Philips Semiconductors: Unknown device 2001
          Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 9
          Memory at ca800000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1K]
          Capabilities: <available only to root>
  
  The cards sold by ALDI earlier this year are using that chipset for
  example.  I've checked in a new km_v4l2 package with a driver for those
  cards into the autobuild, thus Huberts kernels should have support for
  these cards in near future.
  
  It would be nice if lspci, hwinfo and the yast2 module for TV cards
  support these cards.  The module name is saa7134.  PCI IDs are 1131:7130
  and 1131:7134.  The driver will autodetect all cards where a PCI
  Subsystem ID is present, with one exception:  The subsys ID 1131:0000
  doesn't work, this is the one which is used by the chip if the eeprom
  with the PCI Subsystem ID isn't present.  For those cards a card=<nr>
  insmod option is required to make them work.
  
    Gerd
