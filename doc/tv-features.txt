Fetures of a new YaST2 module
=============================

Name: WinTV configurator
~~~~~
Purpose:
~~~~~~~~
Configure the TV card using autodetection or manual configuration.

Possible additional features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- provide a database of cards for manual configuration.
- configure the volume of the soundcard, if the TV card's output is connected
  to the soundcard (ask user about it). Configure the sondcard entirely
  if it is not configured yet.
- support more cards in one computer

- scan for the channels
  - will not be implemented, this is application dependent.
    kwintv provides quite good wizard for this task.
